# Milestone 1: Client Self-Serve Overage Credit Purchase Interface

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the AddCreditsPanel component that allows clients to self-purchase additional credits from within their dashboard. The implementation includes:

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

1. **UI Layout**
   - Header: "Buy Additional Credits"
   - Table layout with 4 credit types (Audience, Enrichment, Pixel, Custom Model)
   - Price per credit display
   - Quantity input fields
   - Real-time subtotal calculations
   - Grand total calculation
   - Purchase button with proper state management

2. **Pricing Logic**
   - Pulls per-credit pricing from `agency_credit_pricing` table
   - Uses client's `agency_id` to fetch correct pricing
   - Stores quantities in component state
   - Calculates subtotals and grand total in real-time
   - Fallback to default pricing if API fails

3. **Purchase Workflow**
   - "Confirm Purchase (Pay Later)" button
   - Saves purchases to `overage_credit_purchases` table
   - Updates `client_credit_balances` immediately
   - Sets `billed_to_client = false` (not charged yet)
   - Sets `billed_to_agency = false` (not charged yet)
   - Form resets on successful purchase

4. **UX Details**
   - Purchase button disabled until quantities > 0
   - Loading states for pricing fetch and purchase
   - Success/error toast notifications
   - Responsive Tailwind styling
   - Info box explaining the "pay later" model

### 🗄️ Database Schema

#### New Tables Created:
1. **`agency_credit_pricing`** - Stores per-credit pricing for each agency
2. **`overage_credit_purchases`** - Tracks client overage purchases for billing

#### Updated Tables:
1. **`credits`** - Existing table used to update current credit balances

### 🚀 How to Test

#### 1. Setup Test Data
```sql
-- Run the seed script with actual agency IDs
-- Replace the UUID with a real agency ID from your accounts table
INSERT INTO public.agency_credit_pricing (agency_id, credit_type, price_per_credit_cents, cost_per_credit_cents)
VALUES 
  ('YOUR_AGENCY_ID', 'audience', 2500, 2000),
  ('YOUR_AGENCY_ID', 'enrichment', 1500, 1200),
  ('YOUR_AGENCY_ID', 'pixel', 1000, 800),
  ('YOUR_AGENCY_ID', 'custom_model', 5000, 4000);
```

#### 2. Test API Endpoint
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/agency-pricing?agencyId=YOUR_AGENCY_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### 3. Test Component
1. Navigate to `/home/[account]/usage`
2. Scroll down to see the "Buy Additional Credits" panel
3. Enter quantities for different credit types
4. Verify subtotals and grand total update correctly
5. Click "Confirm Purchase (Pay Later)"
6. Verify credits are added immediately
7. Check database tables for purchase records

#### 4. Verify Database
```sql
-- Check overage purchases
SELECT * FROM overage_credit_purchases 
WHERE client_id = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check updated credit balances
SELECT * FROM credits 
WHERE account_id = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID';

-- Check agency pricing
SELECT * FROM agency_credit_pricing 
WHERE agency_id = 'YOUR_AGENCY_ID';
```

### 🔄 Integration Points

#### Dependencies Met:
- ✅ Agency pricing set in `agency_credit_pricing` (Milestone 2 dependency)
- ✅ Stripe customer exists (saved at sign-up)
- ✅ Billing system ready for CRON job to auto-charge monthly overages

#### Future Integration:
- Monthly billing CRON job will query `overage_credit_purchases` where `billed_to_client = false`
- Charge clients for their overage purchases
- Update `billed_to_client = true` after successful charge

### 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant calculation updates as user types
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user-friendly error messages
- **Accessibility**: Proper form labels and keyboard navigation
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works well on all screen sizes

### 🔒 Security & Permissions

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Proper policies on all tables
- **Authentication**: Requires authenticated user
- **Authorization**: Users can only access their own data
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation with Zod schemas
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries via Supabase

### 📊 Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Queries**: Single API call for pricing data
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, database syncs in background
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Proper state management to avoid unnecessary updates
