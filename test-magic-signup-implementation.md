# Magic Signup Implementation Test Guide

## âœ… MILESTONE 3 COMPLETED: Magic Sign-Up Link with Embedded Payment Gateway

### ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed:

1. **State Management Issue**: Moved `resellPrices` state from `Step2` component to parent `CreateCodeForm` component
2. **Scope Issues**: Fixed variable access in `onSubmit` function and Step3 component
3. **Database Schema**: Added `resell_prices` and `total_amount_cents` fields to `signup_codes` table
4. **TypeScript Types**: Updated database types and server action schemas

### ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist:

#### âœ… Link Generation
- [ ] Magic link is generated with amount_cents, agency_id, and plan_id in query string
- [ ] Copying/sharing the link preserves correct formatting
- [ ] Amount calculation is accurate based on resell prices

#### âœ… Signup Flow Step 1 (Account)
- [ ] Entering email + password correctly creates a new user account
- [ ] Flow automatically transitions to step 2
- [ ] Error handling for invalid inputs

#### âœ… Signup Flow Step 2 (Payment)
- [ ] Amount_cents is displayed as $XX.XX accurately
- [ ] Stripe test card works in development mode
- [ ] On success:
  - [ ] Card is saved to Stripe customer
  - [ ] Client record is updated with stripe_customer_id
  - [ ] Redirect occurs to success page

#### âœ… Fallbacks
- [ ] Errors in either step are caught and surfaced clearly
- [ ] Edge case: user refreshes page on step 2 and still sees the right amount
